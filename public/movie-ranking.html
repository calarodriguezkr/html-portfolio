<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Kimi No Nawa</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite anime of all-time. Simply perfect. Beautiful story, beautiful script, beautiful animation.</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This is my other favorite anime of all-time. Again, simply perfect.</p>
<h3>Us and Them</h3>
<p>This is a Chinesse co-production with netflix and it is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. I love movies about realistic human relationships and this movie shows the beatiful and painful process of becoming an adult in society and falling in love.</p>
